# Custom-Neural-network-for-non-linear-classification
The code contains a custom neural network implemented from scratch using error back propogation.
The activation layer for each hidden layer used is sigmoidal.
The error is calculated at the end using the cross entrophy.
The hidden layers have 3 neurons in each layer as directed by the problem
statement.
The sigmoidal has a slope parameter which is here on referred to as “Beta” in the
documentation and code.

To compare the network results, a similar network has been created using keras and Tensorflow.
The result of both the networks are similar.
